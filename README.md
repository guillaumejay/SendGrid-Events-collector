SendGrid Event collector
================
When using SendGrid.com to send emails, you can set an url which will be called after each event (mail opened,unsuscribe etc..). You can then store and analyse them.

So, this is a basic project to store these events in a database.

Use WebAPI, Entity Framework, Async.
Include a few tests.

SQL and documentation in the Documentation folder.
