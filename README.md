SendGrid Event collector
================
While using SendGrid.com, you can set an url which will be called after each event (mail opened,unsuscribe etc..) so that you store and analyse them.

So, this is a basic project to store these events in a database.

Use WebAPI, Entity Framework, Async.
Include a few tests.

SQL and documentation in the Documentation folder.
